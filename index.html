        <p>Complex binding in ASP.NET MVC refers to the process of binding complex objects to HTTP requests. Model binding is a feature of ASP.NET MVC that allows controller actions to accept complex object types as parameters. The model binding system retrieves data from various sources such as route data, form fields, and query strings, and provides the data to controllers and Razor pages in method parameters and public properties. For complex types, model binding creates an instance by using the default constructor, without setting properties. Arrays are set to Array.Empty<T> ()</p>

        <p>If the onProgress event is only providing percentages of 0 and 100, it indicates that the intermediate progress updates are not being reported correctly by the uploader. This could be due to several reasons:

Uploader Behavior: The Uploader class you are using may not be configured to emit intermediate progress events. It might be designed to only report when the upload starts (0%) and when it completes (100%).

Backend Implementation: If the Uploader relies on backend responses to track progress, the backend might only be sending start and end signals. Some server-side implementations only notify at the beginning and completion of the upload process.

Network Speed and File Size: If the network speed is very fast and the file size is small, the upload might complete so quickly that intermediate states are not noticeable or captured.</p>
